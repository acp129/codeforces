codeforces expected java programs to not be part of any special package

PermutationSort:
make sure you read entire problem statement (distinct integers makes a lot of difference)

Make sure to review all scenarios.
Need to pick up on java collections.

EshagLovesBigArrays:
none

Collections.sort() sorts to given collection, you don't need to return anything.  How do you generalize
the behaviour of such functions?  All Collections. operations don't return anything??
